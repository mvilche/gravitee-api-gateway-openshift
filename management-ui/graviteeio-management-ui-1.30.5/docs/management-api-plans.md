# API Plans

Retrieve all your registered plans. To subscribe to an API, you must publish one or more Plans. A Plan will allow you to gain access of the API operations.

3 modes are available for plans :

* Staging mode

With a plan in staging mode, you can make changes to the configuration and preview the changes before you make the plan active.

* Published mode

The plan is in active state and consumers can use it to subscribe to the API.

* Closed mode

Plan is closed and cannot be used anymore by the API consumers.

The (+) button let you create a new plan.
