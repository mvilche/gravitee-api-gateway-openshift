# Customize your theme

You will be able to define your theme and observe live preview.

The **panel to the left** of the preview allows you to define your design preferences.

**FULLSCREEN** button makes it easier to edit if you have several screens, the preview opens in a new window.
`Only if Portal URL is configured in Portal settings.`

**RESET** action allows you to reset the theme since the last backup.

**SAVE** button saves your theme.

**ENABLED** switch makes the theme active at portal level.

**RESTORE TO DEFAULT THEME** action overwrites your modifications with the theme that we provide by default.

#### Simple usage

**Images** Add your logos. Optional logo is used for the home page and the footer but it is possible to use only the main logo with
"Use default logo" link.
Add your Homepage background image.

**Colors** Define your primary, neutral, font and skeleton colors.

**Fonts** Choose your font family. Choose your font size. Small are default.

#### Advanced usage

If you want more customization, you can define the graphic properties that we expose for each component.

Each component uses its own properties, but when possible, we group the properties into common variables (see: simple usage)

For the component colors, if you mouse over the color bubble, you can understand what is the common color used.
For others properties, if common property is used, you can see this on the placeholder iof field.
