# API Policies

Policies let you customize, enhance API behavior and functionalities. Policies can enforce security, enhance performance, transform request/response and let you implement some logic via the Groovy Policy or dynamic routing policy.

Policy can be chained, applied to root path (/**) or for specific paths.

You can drag and drop policy at the center of the screen to apply policy for a specific path, and the right part of the screen let you configure your policy.

The (+) button let you create a new path to specify its behavior via the policies.
